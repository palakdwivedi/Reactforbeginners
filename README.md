# Reactforbeginners
I hope this project becomes helpful for the people. We will find many folders after we set up the environment in react. Not all the files are important. In the src folder, only index.css and index.js are important.Similarly in the public folder , only index.html(it is not even touched) is important and we can delete the other files. Two modules are always required while working with react - react and react-dom. Render means to show. It takes three parameters - what to show ,where  to show and call back function. Bable(javascript compiler) and webpack are installed via npm install.
